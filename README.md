Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree Project: News App

This project consists of a News feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location.

In the case of this app, the theme is the most recent News from Brazil.

To extract the news, <a href="http://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/">Guardian API</a> - a well-maintained API which returns information in a JSON format - was used.

### This project includes:

* Connecting to an API
* Parsing the JSON response
* Handling error cases gracefully
* Updating information regularly
* Using an AsyncTask
* Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle

### Updated:
* Implement the Preference Fragment
* Launch a Settings Activity from a menu in the Main Activity
* Use Uri.Builder class to add query parameters to the URL
* Update and display the Preference Summary

### Additional Criteria
The intent of this project is to practice writing raw Java code using the necessary classes provided by the Android framework; therefore, the use of external libraries is not be permitted.
